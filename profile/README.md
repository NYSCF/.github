# New York Stem Cell Foundation

The New York Stem Cell Foundation combines the depth of a highly focused research institute with the breadth of a wide-ranging philanthropic organization. Since its establishment in 2005, NYSCF has invested over $200 million in stem cell research and continues to conduct world-leading stem cell research, both in its own laboratory in New York City, and also in collaboration with major medical research and leading academic institutions around the world.
